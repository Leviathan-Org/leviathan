A little learning is a dangerous thing	People who don't understand something fully are dangerous
A snowball effect	Events have momentum and build upon each other
A snowball's chance in hell	No chance at all
A stitch in time saves nine	Fix the problem now because it will get worse later
A storm in a teacup	A big fuss about a small problem
An apple a day keeps the doctor away	Apples are good for you
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure	You can prevent a problem with little effort. Fixing it later is harder.
As right as rain	Perfect
Bolt from the blue	Something that happened without warning
Burn bridges	Destroy relationships
Calm before the storm	Something bad is coming, but right now it's calm
Come rain or shine	No matter what
Curiosity killed the cat	Stop asking questions
Cut the mustard	Do a good job
Don't beat a dead horse	Move on, this subject is over
Every dog has his day	Everyone gets a chance at least once
Familiarity breeds contempt	The better you know someone the less you like him
Fit as a fiddle	In good health
Fortune favours the bold	Take risks
Get a second wind	Have more energy after having been tired
Get wind of something	Hear news of something secret
Go down in flames	Fail spectacularly
Haste makes waste	You'll make mistakes if you rush through something
Have your head in the clouds	Not be concentrating
He who laughs last laughs loudest	I'll get you back for what you did
Hear something straight from the horse's mouth	Hear something from the person involved
He's not playing with a full deck	He's dumb
He's off his rocker	He's crazy
He's sitting on the fence	He can't make up his mind
It is a poor workman who blames his tools	If you can't do the job, don't blame it on others
It is always darkest before the dawn	Things are going to get better
It takes two to tango	One person alone isn't responsible. Both people are involved.
Jump on the bandwagon	Follow a trend, do what everyone else is doing
Know which way the wind is blowing	Understand the situation (usually negative)
Leave no stone unturned	Look everywhere
Let sleeping dogs lie	Stop discussing an issue
Like riding a bicycle	Something you never forget how to do
Like two peas in a pod	They're always together
Make hay while the sun shines	Take advantage of a good situation
On cloud nine	Very happy
Once bitten, twice shy	You're more cautious when you've been hurt before
Out of the frying pan and into the fire	Things are going from bad to worse
Run like the wind	Run fast
Shape up or ship out	Work better or leave
Snowed under	Busy
That ship has sailed	It's too late
The pot calling the kettle black	Someone criticizing someone else he is just as bad
There are clouds on the horizon	Trouble is coming
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones	People who are morally questionable shouldn't criticize others
Through thick and thin	In good times and in bad times
Time is money	Work quickly
Waste not, want not	Don't waste things and you'll always have enough
We see eye to eye	We agree
Weather the storm	Go through something difficult
Well begun is half done	Getting a good start is important
When it rains it pours	Everything is going wrong at once
You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar	You'll get what you want by being nice
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink	You can't force someone to make the right decision
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs	There's always a cost to doing something
