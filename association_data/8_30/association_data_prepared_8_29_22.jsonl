{"prompt":"how I think ->","completion":" I have a tendency to use short paragraphs; I think I’m scared of long paragraphs. Most of my paragraphs are just long sentences, and most of my sentences are short. Maybe that’s because I’m mentally ill. I think in short sentences and long sentences and so that’s the space I give to each passenger car on my thought train. I’m also high. I wonder how you think — and how people can think differently. I think differently than this a lot, actually, after I’ve thought about it. I think in pictures and dreams and conversations. And I think I can think in more ways.\n"}
{"prompt":"my dad ->","completion":" He has an enormous heart but can't express it. He’s wicked smart but weirdly unaware of how smart he is. This is an interesting way to describe him because nearly everyone that knows him would say the opposite — that he epitomizes the Dunning-Kruger effect, that he thinks he knows more than he does. This is true to a first order approximation. But my dad is smart in the way that I (we?) are smart — he’s manipulative as hell. The annoying part is that he doesn’t get it, and so I fight shadow battles with a man who can’t understand why his son seems so distant.\n"}
{"prompt":"apartheid ->","completion":" The sequence of \"no’s\" that follows you is the only indicator that you’re being held apart, and even that is plausibly deniable. It is to beggar among choosers, to have one’s path reduced, bent, shaped by locked doors and waiting rooms. You are fortunate to have a few options still available, and you are lauded for your perseverance in the face of discrimination. You count your blessings, you are modest, you are made poor. You thank a few for their largesse, and hope to no longer need it, to pay it back if the time comes.\n"}
{"prompt":"software automation ->","completion":" Automation is another thing that everyone in software is obsessed with. Teach a machine to fish, and it’ll fish for a lifetime, or at least until the hardware blows out. It’s easy to conceptualize some automation — imagine some scanner that indexes every file it finds, continuously. If you want to scale it up, you add more machines and backups. Then, if you want to look something up, you check the index instead of searching. All sorts of problems can be solved by stacking machines on top of each other. \n"}
{"prompt":"software engineering ->","completion":" It’s not like I haven’t made money before, I’ve had a few jobs and am living comfortably off my savings. I was a software engineer, which is an easier job than advertised. It is a bit like writing: you read a lot, make edits, keep drafts, and have reviewers. When you publish, the software changes, and then there’s all this commotion making sure it works properly and reasoning about underlying structure and seeing changes reflected in 'reality'. It can be fun. At a lot of companies you claim a \"chapter\" and re-read and re-write it for as long as you want, and you’ll still get paid. Obviously if you’re really good you can re-design entire economies and influence geopolitics, but I wouldn’t know much about that. \n"}

{"prompt":"game night ->","completion":" We thought it would be fun to play a game in which we assigned characters to friends and family members, and then had them act out a scene together. We were wrong — it was a terrible idea. Like a Shakespearean tragedy, or a slow-motion car crash. Or a staff meeting. Or a dreary political campaign. Or a food fight. Or a root canal. Or a wake. \n"}
